# pythonpoetryscript
This is a repository to share the code for my digital poetry assignment for DGST 302 at the University of Mary Washington.

This is a Python script that takes Gutenberg's text file of [Oscar Wilde's *The Picture of Dorian Gray*](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/174) and recreates Jack Kerouac's poem ["In Vain"](https://poets.org/poem/vain) through the use of a template using the words from Dorian Gray. The original code can be found in a [Colaboratory Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1oF2RZFeXHMUlrtG-qLh1DP2LgTag8DX9?usp=sharing). I took inspiration for this type of poem from my professor, Zach Whalen's, work in his own [Template Poetry](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/11cCMGqo6wyoOVvKqfUvf6L2egk4OdQjV?usp=sharing) example he provided for us in class. 

I chose Kerouac's poem as the template for this project because he is one of my favorite poets and authors from the Beat Generation and because I love his style of writing. I chose *The Picture of Dorian Gray* as the text being integrated into this poem because it was one of my favorite books I have read (that is also out of copyright) and thought the text would fit with the theme of Kerouac's original poem.

I created this poem with the intention of doing something similar to Alison Knowles's "The House of Dust" ([here is an examples by Nick Montfort](https://nickm.com/memslam/a_house_of_dust.html)) which is one of the earliest examples of computerized poetry. However, I did not want to simply recreate her project, leading me to find a poem that spoke to me to use as a template. Jack Kerouac's work has had a special place in my heart since reading the intoduction he wrote in [Robert Frank's *The Americans* (1958)](https://www.nga.gov/features/robert-frank/the-americans-1955-57.html) and I wanted to include "In Vain" since it is a fairly historical poem, and I am a person who really enjoys history.

For this repository I have included my Python code, as well as a link to my original Colab Notebook I created it in. Since the notebook calls for the text file of *The Picture of Dorian Gray* to be run in the program, I have also uploaded the edited version I used, though it came directly from [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/).
