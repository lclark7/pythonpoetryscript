# pythonpoetryscript
This is a repository to share the code for my digital poetry assignment for DGST 302 at the University of Mary Washington.

This is a Python script that takes Gutenberg's text file of Oscar Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray and recreates Jack Kerouac's poem "In Vain" through the use of a template using the words from Dorian Gray. The original code can be found in a [Colaboratory Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1oF2RZFeXHMUlrtG-qLh1DP2LgTag8DX9?usp=sharing). I took inspiration for this type of poem from my professor, Zach Whalen's, work in his own [Template Poetry](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/11cCMGqo6wyoOVvKqfUvf6L2egk4OdQjV?usp=sharing) example he provided for us in class. 

I chose Kerouac's poem as the template for this project because he is one of my favorite poets and authors from the Beat Generation and because I love his style of writing. I chose The Picture of Dorian Gray as the text being integrated into this poem because it was one of my favorite books I have read and thought the text would fit with the theme of Kerouac's original poem.
